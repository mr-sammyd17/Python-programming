TASK

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
